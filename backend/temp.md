"❌ Bad Code:\n```javascript\nfunction sum(){return a+b;}\n```\n\n🔍 Issues:\n*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function, meaning they are likely relying on global variables.\n*   ❌ Function should accept parameters to be more reusable and avoid relying on external scope.\n*   ❌ Missing JSDoc comments\n\n✅ Recommended Fix:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Calculates the sum of two numbers.\n *\n * @param {number} a - The first number.\n * @param {number} b - The second number.\n * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.\n */\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n💡 Improvements:\n*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters.\n*   ✔ No longer relies on external variables, making it more predictable and less prone to errors.\n*   ✔ Includes JSDoc comments that explain the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n"
